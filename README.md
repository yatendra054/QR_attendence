# QR_attendence System 

This QR attendence System app is created by python libraries and streamlit . In which first we decode QR and read the data and store into the files.In this have two process one is access grainted and other is access denied.


## About
First, we take a picture of the QR code and create a rectangle to fit it perfectly.

<img src="Image qr/output_image.jpeg" alt="Image 1" width="200" height="200" style="display: inline-block;">
<img src="Image qr/output_image1.jpeg" alt="Image 2" width="200" height="200" style="display: inline-block;">

Then, we create a Streamlit app to process the QR code. The app checks if the QR code is valid. If the QR code contains data such as a website link or other forms of text, access is denied, and a beep sound is produced.
